My Name is Devi Prasad. I am an engineer by training, and a programmer by volition.
I am an independent consultant offering software design and development services.
I also offer teaching and training services for novice as well as practicing software
developers.

I have a doctorate degree in Computer Science from NIT Allahabad.
In my thesis, I developed denotational semantics of advice-weaving for a
class-based aspect-oriented programming language.

I have more than twenty five years of experience writing programs and building software.
I have written device drivers for printers and scanners (SCSI and USB systems). I
have developed high-performance servers in C and Go languages. I have used C++, Java,
and Python for solving problems in different domains. I also have experience writing
ARM assembly.

I recently developed and shipped a high-performnce, message processing server for a large
teleconferencing system. This server is designed to support about 10k concurrent users.
It leverages asynchronous, non-blocking IO facilities of Linux OS. The software is
written entirely in C, and has more than 15k lines of code, interacting with four other 
message processing subsystems.

I enjoy communicating ideas, teaching, and training. I have taught at IIIT - Hyderabad, 
School Of Information Sciences - Manipal University, MIT Manipal, and NMAMIT Nitte. I
have given lectures and tech-talks at developer conferences, academic institutes, and
software industries.

I am an enthusiast of **Formal Methods** and **Functional Programming**. I practice light-weight
formal methods whenever an opportuniry shows up.
