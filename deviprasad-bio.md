My Name is Devi Prasad. I am an engineer by training; I am a programmer, by choice.
I am an independent consultant offering software design and development services.

I earned my doctorate degree in Computer Science from NIT, Allahabad, in 2006.
In my PhD thesis I developed denotational semantics of advice-weaving for an
(class-based) aspect-oriented programming language. I built an interpreter for the
same in Scheme language.

I have more than twenty years of experience writing programs and building software.
I have written device drivers for printers and scanners (SCSI and USB systems). I
have developed high-performance servers in C and Go languages. I have used C++, Java,
and Python for solving specific problems. I have experience writing Android applications
too.

I recently developed and shipped a high-performnce message processing server for a large
teleconferencing system provider. This server leverages asynchronous, non-blocking IO
facilities of Linux OS, for supporting about 10k concurrent users. The software is
written entirely in C, and has more than 15k lines of code, interacting with four other 
message processing subsystems.

I enjoy communicating ideas, teaching and training. I have taught at IIIT-Hyderabad, 
SOIS - Manipal University, MIT Manipal, and NMAMIT, Nitte. I have given lectures and tech-talks
at developer conferences, academic institutes, and in industries.

I am an enthusiast of Formal Methods, and of Functional Programming. I practice light-weight
formal methods in my work whenever an opportuniry shows up.
