My Name is Devi Prasad. I am an engineer by training, and a programmer by volition.
I am an independent consultant offering software design and development services.
I also offer teaching and training services for novice as well as practicing software
developers.

I earned my doctorate degree in Computer Science from NIT, Allahabad.
In my thesis, I developed denotational semantics of advice-weaving for a
class-based aspect-oriented programming language.

I have more than twenty five years of experience writing programs and building software.
I have written device drivers for printers and scanners (SCSI and USB systems). I
have developed high-performance servers in C and Go languages. I have used C++, Java,
and Python for solving problems in different doamins. I have experience writing Android 
applications. I also have experience writing ARM assembly.

I recently developed and shipped a high-performnce, message processing server for a large
teleconferencing system. This server is designed to support about 15k concurrent users.
It leverages asynchronous, non-blocking IO facilities of Linux OS. The software is
written entirely in C, and has more than 15k lines of code, interacting with four other 
message processing subsystems.

I enjoy communicating ideas, teaching and training. I have taught at IIIT-Hyderabad, 
SOIS-Manipal University, MIT Manipal, and NMAMIT Nitte. I have given lectures and tech-talks
at developer conferences, academic institutes, and in software industries.

I am an enthusiast of Formal Methods, and of Functional Programming. I practice light-weight
formal methods in my work whenever an opportuniry shows up.
